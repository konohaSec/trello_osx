# Trello for OS X

 This is the Trello web app packaged into an mac os x app. Feel free to improve in any way. Very simple implementation, using WebShell (https://github.com/djyde/WebShell) and the Trello icon made by Fatih Turan (https://dribbble.com/shots/1774232-Freebie-Trello-App-Icon). Enjoy. The Trello team, djyde and Fatih Turan deserve all the credit.
